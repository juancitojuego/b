# Project Structure Guide

**Important:** The main Next.js application code is located within the `comic-book-inventory` subdirectory.

All development, including adding new pages, components, or API routes, should typically occur within:

```
comic-book-inventory/src/...
```

Please ensure that your working directory context is appropriate when making changes to the application. The root of the Next.js project is `comic-book-inventory/`, not the root of this repository.
